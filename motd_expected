--- SCRATCH SYSTEM FILE DELETION POLICY IN EFFECT STARTING FEB. 1

Since we upgraded our Scratch file system we have not enforced our
180 day file deletion policy. We will begin enforcing this policy starting
February 1. It is important to keep in mind that the scratch file system is
for temporary storage WITHOUT backup service. If you accidentally delete
a file, old files are purged, or the filesystem crashes, they cannot be
restored. Please move your important files to either your home directory
or project space file system. More information can be found here:

--- CRITICAL CHANGE FOR USING $PFSDIR DIRECTORY AT OSC

We have made a critical change in how our scratch filesystem works when you
are using it as part of a batch job. If you use the $PFSDIR variable in your job
scripts or job set up, then this change will apply to you. To fix an ongoing
error with the batch environment, we have disabled the automatic
creation of job directories on the scratch filesystem that used to be part of
the $PFSDIR prologue. You can continue to use scratch in this way, but you
will have to include this explicitly in your job script. Details on how to do
this are included in the known issue documentation.
